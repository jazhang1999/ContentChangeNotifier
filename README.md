# ContentChangeNotifier
Idea: Check any webpage for when it is updated, and be able to pull information off said webpage, all through a terminal without having to search on the web to get to that webpage

## Phase 1: Check for updates
This should only notify the user when an update to the page has been made. Often, this is as simple as checking to see if “last updated” section has a new date, or by checking in the source code to see if changes have been made

## Phase 2: What changes
This should check that if there are changes, what has changed. The user will get information on what has changed (all of it). Depending on what kind of change we want to see, then we will find some applicable way to present all of it (solid dump)

## Phase 3: Limitations on information
Often, a use does not want to see every little change, so probably the hardest step would be to find out how to limit the amount of information being shown to be most relevant to said user. Of course, this will be tailored for each type of site, so we will most likely start specific and get general over time

## Additional Requests:
* This program runs daily, or will at least specify what it has found over the span of 24 hours
* An email will be sent to the proper address detailing the findings / results of said program (most likely will be sent at 11:59 PM, and reset at 12:00 AM)
* Either a mod page (video game) or a page with solid text (wiki or other text presentation)

## Resources:
* Using Linux (Most likely some form of Ubuntu) terminal
* Using an editor, not an IDE (probably either Vim, Emacs, or Atom)
* Either Java, Python, or C (Most likely either Python or Java)
